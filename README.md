# Data-Analysis-of-HIV-Dataset-cleaning

Hii Everyone,

In this repository, I have done data analysis using Jupyter notebook(python) and data visualization using Tableau.

I have followed certains steps to clean data,analyze and visualize data. 

a) Removed the brackets as well as numbers inside the brackets in both the sheets preferably using python.
b) Take the sheets to tableau
c) Join the tables using inner join on WHO region column.
d) Start building the dashboard.
